This page is a collection of Gnosis beacon chain call examples for the Gnosis API using:

* [cURL](https://curl.se/)

For a detailed description of all the available beacon chain API specifications, see [Eth Beacon chain API](https://ethereum.github.io/beacon-APIs/).

## What is the Gnosis beacon chain API

The Gnosis beacon chain API allows developers to communicate with the Gnosis beacon chain to build applications.

To read data from and send transactions to the Gnosis beacon chain, an application must connect to a Gnosis beacon chain endpoint.

## How to start using the Gnosis beacon chain API

To use the Gnosis beacon chain API, you need access to a Gnosis beacon chain endpoint.

Follow these steps to sign up on Chainstack, deploy a Gnosis RPC node, and find your endpoint credentials:

1. <a href="https://console.chainstack.com/user/account/create" target="_blank">Sign up with Chainstack</a>.
1. [Deploy a node](/platform/join-a-public-network#join-an-ethereum-network).
1. [View node access and credentials](/platform/view-node-access-and-credentials).

Now you are ready to connect to the Gnosis blockchain and use the Gnosis API to build.

Find useful [Gnosis tools](/operations/gnosis/tools#interaction-tools) in the Chainstack docs.
